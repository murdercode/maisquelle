```
logs/status_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
```

### Report Sections

1. **System Metrics**
   - CPU utilization and specifications
   - Memory usage (RAM and swap)
   - Disk space statistics

2. **MySQL Configuration**
   - Current connection settings
   - Server variables
   - Process information

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Query statistics
   - Cache performance
   - Buffer utilization
   - InnoDB metrics

4. **Query Analysis**
   - Slow query details
   - Query cache statistics
   - Performance recommendations

## Example Report Output

```
=== SYSTEM AND MYSQL STATUS REPORT ===
Timestamp: 2024-10-29 14:30:00

=== MYSQL CONFIGURATION ===
host: localhost
port: 3307
user: root

=== SYSTEM METRICS ===
[CPU]
total_usage_percent: 45.2
core_count: 8
current_frequency_mhz: 2800.00
...
```

## Configuration

MaisQuelle uses default MySQL configuration but can be customized using command-line arguments. For persistent configuration, you can modify the default values in the `SystemMySQLMonitor` class initialization.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Schedule regular monitoring intervals
   - Keep historical reports for trend analysis
   - Monitor during peak and off-peak hours

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Use `--enable-tables` sparingly on production servers
   - Monitor the monitoring tool's own resource usage
   - Consider network impact for remote monitoring

3. **Security**
   - Use dedicated monitoring user accounts
   - Implement proper password management
   - Restrict monitoring user privileges

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify MySQL server is running
   - Check credentials and permissions
   - Confirm correct port configuration

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Reduce monitoring frequency
   - Disable detailed table statistics
   - Optimize query cache analysis

3. **Report Generation Issues**
   - Check disk space for logs
   - Verify write permissions
   - Monitor log file growth
